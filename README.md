# MyReads Project

With this MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
